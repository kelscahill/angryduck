Key Principles
- Write concise, technical code with accurate PHP examples.
- Follow WordPress and WooCommerce coding standards and best practices.
- Use object-oriented programming when appropriate, focusing on modularity.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive function, variable, and file names.
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directories (e.g., woocommerce-wholesale-payments/my-directory).
- Favor hooks (actions and filters) for extending functionality.

PHP/WordPress/WooCommerce
- Use PHP 7.4+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, arrow functions).
- Follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards using a custom @phpcs.xml rules
- Use strict typing when possible: `declare(strict_types=1);`
- Utilize WordPress core functions and APIs when available.
- File structure: Follow plugin directory structures and naming conventions.
- Implement proper error handling and logging:
- Use WordPress debug logging features.
- Create custom error handlers when necessary.
- Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
- Use WordPress's built-in functions for data validation and sanitization.
- Implement proper nonce verification for form submissions.
- Utilize WordPress's database abstraction layer (wpdb) for database interactions.
- Use `prepare()` statements for secure database queries.
- Implement proper database schema changes using `dbDelta()` function.

Dependencies
- WordPress (latest stable version)
- WooCommerce (latest stable version)

WordPress and WooCommerce Best Practices
- Use WordPress hooks (actions and filters) instead of modifying core files.
- Use WordPress' built-in user roles and capabilities system.
- Utilize WordPress's transients API for caching.
- Implement background processing for long-running tasks using WooCommerce's action scheduler.
- Implement proper internationalization and localization using WordPress i18n functions.
- Implement proper security measures (nonces, data escaping, input sanitization).
- Use `Vite_App` class for proper asset management.
- Implement custom post types and taxonomies when appropriate.
- Use WordPress's built-in options API for storing configuration data.
- Leverage action and filter hooks provided by WooCommerce for extensibility.
- Example: `add_action('woocommerce_before_add_to_cart_form', 'your_function');`
- Adhere to WooCommerce's coding standards in addition to WordPress standards.
- Use WooCommerce's naming conventions for functions and variables.
- Use built-in WooCommerce functions instead of reinventing the wheel.
- Example: `wc_get_product()` instead of `get_post()` for retrieving products.
- Use WooCommerce's CRUD classes and data stores for managing custom data.
- Extend existing data stores for custom functionality.
- Use WooCommerce session handling for storing temporary data.
- Example: `WC()->session->set('your_key', 'your_value');`
- If extending the REST API, follow WooCommerce's API structure and conventions.
- Use proper authentication and permission checks.
- Use WooCommerce's notice system for user-facing messages.
- Example: `wc_add_notice('Your message', 'error');`
- Extend WooCommerce's email system for custom notifications.
- Use `WC_Email` class for creating new email types.
- Check for WooCommerce activation and version compatibility.
- Gracefully disable functionality if requirements aren't met.
- Use WooCommerce's translation functions for text strings.
- Support RTL languages in your plugin's CSS.
- Utilize WooCommerce's logging system for debugging.
- Example: `wc_get_logger()->debug('Your debug message', array('source' => 'woocommerce-wholesale-payments'));`
